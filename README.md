This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error stemming from the language's loose typing system. The `bug.js` file contains a function that unintentionally concatenates strings instead of performing numerical addition.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, addresses this by explicitly type-checking the inputs or using the Number() function for safe conversion. This example highlights the importance of careful type handling in JavaScript to prevent unexpected behavior.
